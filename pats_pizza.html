                        <li>
                            I decided to make a pie chart to see different ways that people
                            were ordering from Pat's Pizza.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After seeing that an average of 5% of people were ordering from the mobile app.
                            I knew I had to do something.
                        </li>

                <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:40px; color:rgb(241, 241, 241);">Why?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li style="line-height: 1.75em ">
                        Let's be real. When you order food delivery, how do you do it? 
                        Most likely, you use apps like DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Grubhub. <br> 
                        My goal was to make the Pat's app as accessible as those apps.
                
                        With the continuous rise of food service apps, <br> I believe it is a 
                        matter of time before Pat's Pizza customers begin to switch to 
                        other food options if they can't order their food <br>as easily as they 
                        can with other restaurants.
                
                        My goal was to get app usage to about 25%. In order to do so, I needed 
                        to <br>figure out what was preventing people from using our app.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:40px; color:rgb(241, 241, 241);">Survey</h2>
                <ul style="line-height: 1.75em; text-align: left;">
                    <li >
                        I asked fellow students at University of Delaware to use the existing 
                        Pat's Pizza app to order anything that they wanted and recorded <br>their comments.
                        Afterwards, I also asked them the following questions: 
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li >
                        How was your overall process with the app?
                    </li>
                    <li>Did you find anything difficult?</li>
                    <li>Did it take you longer than expected to order your meal?</li>
                    <li>What's one thing you would change about the app?</li>
                    <li>Do you have any final comments?</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:40px; color:rgb(241, 241, 241);">Affinity Mapping</h2>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.75em; text-align: left; ">
                <li>
                    In order to better visualize user's comments about the existing Pat's Pizza app, 
                    I created an affinity map. <br> I took comments from 4 individuals 
                    who attend UD who have never used the app before.
